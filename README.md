I create a stack game inspired by a game on the
[app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stack)


The objective of the game is to stack the boxes as high as possible. each time you stack a box the overlap is removed so the boxes get smaller and smaller.

`
I used threejs for the 3d rendering and cannonjs for the physics simulation. The skybox is a cube with with 6 meshbasicmatrial. The boxes that are stacked are are meshlambertmatrial so they are affected by light sources. There are 2 light sources an ambiant light and a directional lightThe camera is a perpective camera.
